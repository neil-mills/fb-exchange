This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Farrow & Ball Exchange

A concept application I personally dreamt up after personal experience of really expensive paint going to waste!. A marketplace to trade partly used tins of Farrow & Ball paint. Each user can create a personal want list as well as post their partly used tins to use in exchange.
I decided to use node along with mongo db to advance my skills in these technologies.
** Currently work in progress **
